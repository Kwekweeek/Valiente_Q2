## Data Structure and Algorithm Analysis
### Quiz #02

Create a Java program that performs the following tasks using Bubble Sort and Selection
Sort:
1. Input the Power Levels
   - Ask the user to enter the power levels of 10 creatures.
   - Store these values in an integer array.
2. Bubble Sort Implementation
   - Sort the power levels in ascending order using the Bubble Sort algorithm.
   - Display the sorted list.
3. Selection Sort Implementation
   - Sort the power levels in descending order using the Selection Sort algorithm.
   - Display the sorted list.
4. Calculate and Display Analysis:
   - Sum of Even Numbers: Calculate and display the sum of even power levels.
   - Sum of Odd Numbers: Calculate and display the sum of odd power levels.
   - Min and Max Power Levels: Display the minimum and maximum power levels from the array.

## Requirements:
 - Accepts exactly 10 integer inputs representing the power levels of creatures.
 - Implements Bubble Sort correctly to sort the array in ascending order.
 - Implements Selection Sort correctly to sort the array in descending order.
 - Displays the sorted lists.
 - Correctly calculates and displays the sum of even numbers from the array.
 - Correctly calculates and displays the sum of odd numbers from the array.
 - Identifies and displays the minimum power level.
 - Identifies and displays the maximum power level.
 - Add comments to explain your code.
